Tier 1 scope: artist nodes and track nodes only, with one weighted edge from
every track to every candidate artist (weight = metadata compatibility score).
There are no track<->track edges yet; those are Tier 2. Keeping the graph a clean
reframing of ``scoring.compute_score_matrix`` means the UI and metric read the same
